1. **Create a Markdown file**: Create a new .md file in the `docs/` directory
2. **Add content**: Write your content using Markdown syntax
3. **Configure sidebar**: Add metadata to customize the sidebar label and position
4. **Automatic integration**: Docusaurus automatically creates a sidebar from the docs folder

Example from your documentation:
```markdown
docs/hello.md
---
sidebar_label: 'Hi!'
sidebar_position: 3
---
# Hello
This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

The document will be automatically available in your site navigation."""

‚Ä¢ **Focus on Content**: Lets you focus on your docs while handling the technical aspects
‚Ä¢ **React-Powered**: Built with React, allowing you to extend or customize your website layout
‚Ä¢ **Documentation-Focused**: Specifically designed for creating documentation sites

From your intro page, you can get started by creating a new site and it takes less than 5 minutes to discover Docusaurus basics."""

1. Generate a new site: `npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic`
2. Navigate to your site: `cd my-website`
3. Start development server: `npm run start`
4. Open http://localhost:3000/ to view your site

The documentation mentions you can also try Docusaurus immediately with docusaurus.new for a quick preview."""
